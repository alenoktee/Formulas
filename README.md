The program was developed in few hours, taking into account switching to other disciplines in the college besides this one.

## **Briefly about the application:**

The user can select one of the formulas for calculation and enter the required values for the calculation. When you switch to one of the formulas, the input fields for the other form are erased along with the values ​​entered in them.

The program has restrictions on input: it is impossible to enter letters or extra symbols, and when you enter a comma into an empty line, the construction “0,” immediately appears in the line.

The first formula uses the simple "Factorial" method in calculations, while the second uses only mathematics.
