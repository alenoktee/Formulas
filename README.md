# **Exercise:**

Develop an application for calculating the value of an expression with a choice of calculation formula.

The program was developed in 1 days, taking into account switching to other disciplines in the college besides this one.

## **Briefly about the application:**

On the main form you can select one of 5 days of the week and the department you are interested in. The table will display the schedule of all groups in this department for the selected day. Groups are sorted in ascending order (1st-4th year).

When creating a group, a new XML file is created with the name of this group, and the name of the group is placed in Groups.xml (contains a list of all groups).

An example of an XML file for one of the groups:

Then, when editing and saving the schedule, the program reads all lines from the datagridview and updates the file for this group.

Whenever groups or schedules change (within the application), the main form is updated.
